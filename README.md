# Non-Gaussian Likelihoods in Pantheon+: Dark Energy Model Comparison and Tighter Constraints on $H_0$
Paper: 
A collection of outputs of the nested sampling software Polychord run on Type 1a SNe, comparing a series of cosmologys and scatter models

Included are all of the chains (and .paramnames files) used in the paper, as well as a simple code to be used to generate triangle plots of the data.
